The result of core expansion is to produce systems with novel spectral and electronic features, interesting and, often unprece- dented, cation-coordination properties, and, in many cases, an ability to bind anions in certain protonation states.Also adding to the appeal of expanded porphyrins is their central role in addressing issues of aromaticity. In many cases, they also display structural features, such as decidedly nonplanar "figure-eight" motifs, that have no antecedents in the chemistry of porphyrins or related macrocyclic compounds. In this Review, the various synthetic approaches now being employed to produce expanded porphyrins as well as their various applications-related aspects are discussed.},

However, it is difficult to hold one $\pi$-conjugated molecular ring inside another. Here, we show that ring-in-ring complexes, consisting of a 6-porphyrin ring locked inside a 12-porphyrin ring, can be assembled by placing different metals in the two rings (zinc and aluminum). A bridging ligand with carboxylate and imidazole binding sites forms spokes between the two rings, resulting in a highly cooperative supramolecular self-assembly process. Excitation is transferred from the inner 6-ring to the outer 12-ring of this Russian doll complex within 40 ps. These complexes lead to a form of template-directed synthesis in which one nanoring promotes formation of a larger concentric homologous ring; here, the effective template is an eight-component noncovalent assembly. Russian doll templating provides a new approach to amplifying the size of a covalent nanostructure.},

Such diporphyrins prepared include meso-beta doubly linked diporphyrins 7, meso-meso beta-beta beta-beta triply linked diporphyrins 8, and meso-meso beta-beta doubly linked diporphyrins 9. Oxidation of 5,15-diaryl-substituted and 5,10,15-triaryl-substituted Ni(II)-, Cu(II)-, and Pd(II)-porphyrins with tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate (BAHA) in CHCl(3) afforded 7, and triply linked Cu(II)-diporphyrins 8a and 8g were respectively prepared by the oxidation of meso-meso singly linked Cu(II)-diporphyrins 5c and 5f with BAHA. Meso-meso beta-beta doubly linked Ni(II)-diporphyrin 9a was isolated along with triply linked Ni(II)-diporphyrin 8e from the similar oxidation of meso-meso singly linked Ni(II)-diporphyrin 5a. Doubly linked diporphyrins 7 and 9a both exhibit significantly perturbed electronic absorption spectra, in which the Soret-like bands are largely split at around 405-418 and 500-616 nm and the Q-bandlike absorption bands are substantially intensified and red-shifted at 748-820 nm, probably as a consequence of symmetry lowering. Triply linked diporphyrins 8 display more strongly perturbed electronic absorption spectra with split Soret-like bands at 408-419 and 567-582 nm and Q-bandlike absorption bands reaching far-infrared region. Structures of three types of fused diporphyrins 7b and 7c, 8g and 8j, and 9a have been unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography to be nearly coplanar. Both the triply linked diporphyrins 8g and 8j exhibit very flat structures, whereas the doubly linked diporphyrins 7b and 7c exhibit ruffled structures. The doubly linked diporphyrin 9a shows a helically twisted conformation with larger ruffling toward the opposite directions and has been actually separated into two enantiomers, which display strong Cotton effects in the CD spectra. The first oxidation potentials (E(OX1)) decrease in the order of 5 {>} 7 {>} or = 9 {>} 8, indicating lift-up of HOMO orbital in this order, and split potential differences DeltaE = E(OX1) - E(OX2), in turn, increase in the reverse order of 5 {<} 7{<} or = 9 {<} 8. The (1)H NMR spectra have indicated that the aromatic porphyrin ring current becomes weakened in the order of 5 {>} 7 {>} 8. Collectively, the electronic interactions between the diporphyrins have been concluded to increase in the other of 5 {<} 7 {<} or = 9 {<} 8.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular engineering offers opportunities for creating polymer-based materials with tailored conductive properties. However, this requires an understanding of intermolecular interaction effects on intramolecular charge transport. We present a study of hole transport along molecular wires consisting of fluorenep-biphenyl or Znporphyrin monomer units, in dilute solutions. The intramolecular hole mobility was studied by pulse radiolysistime-resolved microwave conductivity. Experiments were supplemented by charge transport simulations employing a quantum-mechanical description of the hole and a classical description of the polymer and solvent dynamics. The model was parametrized using ab initio and molecular dynamics calculations. It was found that the solvent-induced energy disorder along a polymer chain in common solvents (benzene, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, water) is 1 eV, significantly greater than the values of 0.050.2 eV commonly cited in the literature. Environment-induced disorder of this magnitude has profound consequences for intramolecular charge transport. The hole initial state upon injection onto a molecular wire also influences the mobility. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that supramolecular modification of polymers (coordination, rotaxination) can significantly enhance or suppress charge transport. Incorporating a molecular level description of the immediate supramolecular and solvent environment into charge transport models improves their predictive potential, providing a valuable tool for material design.},

All of the dimers show very large peak cross section values, sigma(2) = (3-10) x 10(3) GM (1 GM = 1 x 10(-50) cm(4) s photon(-1)), which is several hundred times larger than that obtained for the corresponding monomer in the same region. We explain such dramatic cooperative enhancement by a combination of several factors, such as strong enhancement of the lowest one-photon Q-transition, better resonance conditions in the three-level system, dramatic enhancement of the excited-state singlet-singlet transition, and parallel arrangement of consecutive transitions in dimers, as compared to perpendicular arrangement in the monomer. We show that the absolute values of the 2PA cross section in these molecules are quantitatively described by a quantum-mechanical expression, derived for the three-level model. We also demonstrate the possibility of singlet oxygen generation upon one- and two-photon excitation of these dimers, which makes them particularly attractive for photodynamic therapy.},

The block-localized wave function (BLW)-derived aromatic stabilization energies (ASE) of several porphyrinoids reveal that, on a per atom basis, the appended 6$\pi$ electron heterocycles of porphyrinoids confer aromaticity much more effectively than the macrocyclic 4n+2 $\pi$ electron conjugations. There is no direct relationship between thermochemical stability of porphyrinoids and their macrocyclic 4n or 4n+2 $\pi$ electron counts. Porphyrinoids having an "antiaromatic" macrocyclic 4n+2 $\pi$ electron conjugation pathway (e.g., 4) as well as those having no macrocyclic conjugation (e.g., 9) can be stabilized by aromaticity. Computed nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) and the anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) disclose the intricate local versus macrocyclic circulation interplay for several porphyrinoids.},

First, we investigate the effects of different ligands in the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of a porphyrin bearing two aryl iodides with a porphyrin bearing an aryl ethyne. Triphenylarsine affords faster rates than triphenylphosphine or tri-2-furylphosphine when experiments are performed in conjunction with tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) under anaerobic conditions. Reactions performed at 35 degrees C are relatively clean, fast (complete in 1-2 h), and afford the ethyne-linked porphyrin array in similar to 70{\%} yield with a minimal amount of higher molecular weight byproducts. This reaction is ideal for preparing multi-porphyrin arrays. Second, treatment-of a free base porphyrin-ethyne with a stoichiometric amount of Pd(PPh(3))(2)Cl-2, or a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)-dipalladium(0) and tri-2-furylphosphine, in toluene/triethylamine (5:1) in air at 50-60 degrees C affords the butadiyne-linked porphyrin dimer in similar to 70{\%} yield. With Pd(PPh(3))(4) in toluene under anaerobic conditions at 100 degrees C, the porphyrin-ethyne reacts to give the head-to-tail enyne-linked dimer (29{\%} yield). Size exclusion chromatography is effective in analyzing reaction mixtures and purifying the porphyrin arrays. These copper-free coupling reactions afford direct access to ethyne-, butadiyne-, or enyne-linked arrays of free base and/or zinc porphyrins from readily available porphyrin building blocks.},

  abstract     = {We have used single-crystal X-ray diffraction and time-resolved UV-NIR-IR absorption spectroscopy to gain insights into the structures and excited-state dynamics of a rotaxane consisting of a hexayne chain threaded through a phenanthroline macrocycle and a family of related compounds, including the rhenium(I) chlorocarbonyl complex of this rotaxane. The hexayne unit in the rhenium-rotaxane is severely nonlinear; it is bent into an arc with an angle of 155.6(1) between the terminal C1 and C12 atoms and the centroid of the central C-C bond, with the most acute distortion at the point where the polyyne chain pushes against the Re(CO)3Cl unit. There are strong through-space excited-state interactions between the components of the rotaxanes. In the metal-free rotaxane, there is rapid singlet excitation energy transfer (EET) from the macrocycle to the hexayne ($\tau$ = 3.0 ps), whereas in the rhenium-rotaxane there is triplet EET, from the macrocycle complex (3)MLCT state to the hexayne ($\tau$ = 1.5 ns). This study revealed detailed information on the short-lived higher excited state of the hexayne (lifetime 1 ps) and on structural reorganization and cooling of hot polyyne chains, following internal conversion (over 5 ps). Comparison of the observed IR bands of the excited states of the hexayne with results from time-dependent density functional calculations (TD DFT) shows that these excited states have high cumulenic character (low bond length alternation) around the central region of the chain. These findings shed light on the complex interactions between the components of this supramolecular rotaxane and are important for the development of materials for the emerging molecular and nanoscale electronics.},

Although the usefulness of this model had already been demonstrated in the late sixties by the landmark syntheses of sapphyrins by R. B. Woodward and of corroles by A. W. Johnson, the cornucopia of novel porphyrinoid chromophores it entails became apparent only in recent years. Guided by experience in annulene chemistry, we embarked some time ago on a systematic exploration of potentially aromatic porphyrin structural variants that could be expected to generate interdisciplinary interest. As a result, the porphycenes and metalloporphycenes as well as the tetraoxa-, tetrathia- and tetraselenaporphyrin dications were discovered. In this account our latest contributions to the field - homologues of porphyrin, of porphycene and of the tetraoxaporphyrin dication, isophlorins, isocorroles and metalloisocorroles - will be surveyed.},

As such, we have continuously witnessed the emergence of expanded porphyrins that exhibit unprecedented structures and properties, as is highlighted by the facile realization of Möbius aromatic and even antiaromatic systems with twisted molecular structures.

  abstract     = {Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS)-based methods are very popular for the determination of the induced magnetic field under an external magnetic field. These methods are used mostly (but not only) for the determination of the aromaticity and antiaromaticity of molecules and ions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ghost atom that serves as the NICS probe senses the induced magnetic field and reports it in the form of an NMR chemical shift. However, the source of the field cannot be determined by NICS. Thus, in a multi-ring system that may contain more than one induced current circuit (and therefore more than one source of the induced magnetic field) the NICS value may represent the sum of many induced magnetic fields. This may lead to wrong assignments of the aromaticity (and antiaromaticity) of the systems under study. In this paper, we present a NICS-based method for the determination of local and global ring currents in conjugated multi-ring systems. The method involves placing the NICS probes along the X axis, and if needed, along the Y axis, at a constant height above the system under study. Following the change in the induced field along these axes allows the identification of global and local induced currents. The best NICS type to use for these scans is NICS$\pi$ZZ , but it is shown that at a height of 1.7 Å above the molecular plane, NICSZZ provides the same qualitative picture. This method, namely the NICS-XY-scan, gives information equivalent to that obtained through current density analysis methods, and in some cases, provides even more details.},

The coefficients did not correlate well with water chemistry, but decreased with increasing light dose. A first-order rate coefficient of 0.4 yr1 was calculated for the primary photochemical process NO3 + h$\upsilon$ = NO2 + O(3P) under sea surface equatorial insolation and cloudiness conditions. However, no significant nitrate concentration decreases could be detected, suggesting an upper limit for the net first-order nitrate loss rate coefficient of 0.3 yr1.

  abstract     = {In this work we present experimental and calculated two-dimensional electronic spectra for a 5,15-bisalkynyl porphyrin chromophore. The lowest energy electronic Qy transition couples mainly to a single 380 cm-1 vibrational mode. The two-dimensional electronic spectra reveal diagonal and cross peaks which oscillate as a function of population time. We analyse both the amplitude and phase distribution of this main vibronic transition as a function of excitation and detection frequencies. Even though Feynman diagrams provide a good indication of where the amplitude of the oscillating components are located in the excitation-detection plane, other factors also affect this distribution. Specifically, the oscillation corresponding to each Feynman diagram is expected to have a phase that is a function of excitation and detection frequencies. Therefore, the overall phase of the experimentally observed oscillation will reflect this phase dependence. Another consequence is that the overall oscillation amplitude can show interference patterns resulting from overlapping contributions from neighbouring Feynman diagrams. These observations are consistently reproduced through simulations based on third order perturbation theory coupled to a spectral density described by a Brownian oscillator model.},

Pulse radiolysis of P3DT in THF determined the spatial extent of one negative polaron to be {\~{}}11.5 thiophene units by observing transient absorption of P3DT(-•) radical ions, which are prinicpally free ions, at 850 nm with $\epsilon$ = (7.25 ± 0.47) × 10(4) M(-1) cm(-1) and bleaching of the neutral absorption band at 450 nm. P3DT(-•) was formed in a combination of diffusive reactions and fast "step" processes. Similarly, a positive polaron of P3DT was estimated to delocalize over {\~{}}8.7 thiophene units by pulse radiolysis in chloroform. Chemical reduction by sodium and oxidation by FeCl(3) injected multiple charges into a single P3DT chain while showing absorption spectra in the early stages of reaction resembling those observed by pulse radiolysis. The results indicated that multiple polarons exist in a single chain of P3DT before coalescing into bipolarons or transforming into other forms of polaron.},

In the 4n + 2 series a "transition" from delocalized to localized structures occurs at 4n + 2 = 30. Various indices of aromaticity, including NMR chemical shifts, bond localization, and aromatic stabilization energy (ASE) were monitored. pi-bond localization occurs not due to a dramatic decrease of ASE as n increases, but rather as a result of a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) effect that sets in as the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases with increasing size. The NMR measures of aromaticity (difference between inner and outer H-1 chemical shielding constants and the nucleus-independent chemical shifts, NICS) are reduced in the localized structures in comparison to the delocalized ones. The gradual nature of this "transition" is also implied by the relatively large values of the NMR measures of aromaticity that approach zero only gradually for larger size annulenes. Therefore intermediate size annulenes, such as [30]annulene are predicted to have a localized structure and aromatic properties at the same time showing the delocalized structure is not a necessary condition to be aromatic.

This persistent current has been the focus of considerable theoretical and experimental work, but its basic properties remain a topic of controversy. The main experimental challenges in studying persistent currents have been the small signals they produce and their exceptional sensitivity to their environment. We have developed a technique for detecting persistent currents that allows us to measure the persistent current in metal rings over a wide range of temperatures, ring sizes, and magnetic fields. Measurements of both a single ring and arrays of rings agree well with calculations based on a model of non-interacting electrons.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical calculations of the geometries, electronic structures and electronic absorption spectra of a series of covalently-linked porphyrin dimers are reported. The diporphyrins comprise 5,10,15-triphenylporphyrinatozinc(II) (ZnTriPP) units linked through the meso carbons by two-atom bridges, namely 1,2-ethanediyl (1), trans-1,2-ethenediyl (2), ethynediyl (3), 1,2-iminomethenediyl (4), and transdiazenediyl (5). The structures were optimised in toluene solvent by Density Functional Theory (DFT), using the integral equation formalism variant of the polarizable continuum model. The calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The complete molecules were modelled, with no substitution of smaller groups on the periphery. In parallel, the compounds 2–5 were prepared by known or novel synthetic routes, to enable comparisons of experimental electronic absorption spectra with those calculated using time dependent-DFT at the same level of theory. As the ethane dimer 1 is not yet synthetically accessible, the model monomer meso-2-phenylethylZnTriPP was used for comparisons with the theoretical predictions. The results form a self-consistent set, enabling for the first time legitimate comparisons of the electronic structures of the series, especially regarding the degree to which the porphyrin p-systems interact by conjugation across the bridges. The theoretical calculations of the electronic transitions match the observed spectra in toluene to a remarkable degree, especially with respect to the peak maximum of the Q band, which represents to a large degree the energy of the HOMO–LUMO transition. The imine 4 is intrinsically polar due to the asymmetric bridge, and the HOMO is located almost exclusively on the ZnTriPP unit attached to the nitrogen of the imine, and the LUMO on the C-attached ring. Thus the Q-band transition is mapped as a comprehensive charge-transfer from the former ring to the latter. This may have consequences for the non-linear optical properties of the system. The azoporphyrin 5 exhibits the largest splittings between the interacting MOs via the conjugated bridge, vindicating a prediction by Anderson and co-workers in 2002, and confirmed experimentally by our synthesis of 5. The collected results also indicate that this level of theory is more thanadequate as a model with which to handle these large delocalised molecules.},

The efficacy of this treatment depends on the viscosity of the medium through which the cytotoxic agent must diffuse. Here, spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements of a porphyrin-dimer-based molecular rotor are used to quantify intracellular viscosity changes in single cells. We show that there is a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the immediate environment of the rotor on photoinduced cell death. The effect of this viscosity increase is observed directly in the diffusion-dependent kinetics of the photosensitized formation and decay of a key cytotoxic agent, singlet molecular oxygen. Using these tools, we provide insight into the dynamics of diffusion in cells, which is pertinent to drug delivery, cell signalling and intracellular mass transport.},

A rapid screening method based on laser desorption mass spectrometry has enabled the degree of rearrangement to be examined as a function of the acid catalyst, reagent concentration, reagent stoichiometry, solvent, salts, and temperature. For condensations involving 5-mesityldipyrromethane, we identified reaction at 10 mM concentration in CH(2)Cl(2) with 17.8 mM TFA as optimal conditions for suppression of the rearrangement reaction. A synthetic procedure based on these conditions allowed the expedient synthesis of multigram batches of eight trans-porphyrins in 48-14{\%} yield from 5-mesityldipyrromethane, with minimal chromatography. The same conditions were also effective for the synthesis of two trans-porphyrins derived from 5-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)dipyrromethane. Application of the same conditions to condensations involving 5-phenyldipyrromethane showed extensive rearrangement. Examination of a wide range of conditions showed that slow reactions are associated with less rearrangement. Two sets of conditions were identified that gave little or no scrambling: (1) condensation at 10 mM in MeCN at 0 degrees C with BF(3).Et(2)O catalysis in the presence of NH(4)Cl followed by DDQ oxidation and (2) condensation at 0.1 M in DMSO at 100 degrees C in the presence of NH(4)Cl (with no added acid catalyst) with air oxidation. Although yields are typically less than 10{\%}, the elimination of the need to perform tedious chromatography improves the methodology available for the preparation of trans-porphyrins, derived from sterically unhindered dipyrromethanes.},

Its UV/Vis/NIR absorption and fluorescence spectra resemble those of a previously reported six-porphyrin ring, but are red-shifted by approximately 300 cm(-1), reflecting increased conjugation. Ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrates extensive excited-state delocalization. Transfer of electronic excitation from an initially formed state polarized in the direction of the nanotube axis (z axis) to an excited state polarized in the xy plane occurs within 200 fs, resulting in a negative fluorescence anisotropy on excitation at 742 nm.},

  abstract     = {By means of non-perturbative ab initio calculations, it is shown that paramagnetic closed-shell molecules are characterized by a strongly non-linear magnetic response, whose main feature consists of a paramagnetic-to-diamagnetic transition in a strong magnetic field. The physical origin of this phenomenon is rationalised on the basis of an analytical model based on molecular orbital theory. For the largest molecules considered here, the acepleiadylene dianion and the corannulene dianion, the transition field is of the order of 10(3) T, about one order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field strength currently achievable in experimental settings. However, our simple model suggests that the paramagnetic-to-diamagnetic transition is a universal property of paramagnetic closed-shell systems in strong magnetic fields, provided no singlet-triplet level crossing occurs for fields smaller than the critical transition field. Accordingly, fields weaker than 100 T should suffice to trigger the predicted transition for systems whose size is still well within the (medium-large) molecular domain, such as hypothetical antiaromatic rings with less than one hundred carbon atoms.},

  abstract     = {Nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) have been used extensively for the identification of aromaticity properties of molecules, ions, intermediates, and transition states since their introduction in 1996 by Schleyer et al. Initially, probes (bq's) were placed at the centers of systems (NICS(0)) and later, 1A above the molecular planes (NICS(1)). However, contradicting assignments of aromaticity by NICS and other methods were found for some systems. In this article, an alternative NICS-based method is introduced. The method is based on scanning NICS values over a distance and separating them into in-plane and out-of plane contributions. The shapes of the plots of the chemical shifts and their components as a function of the distance of the NICS probe (bq) from the molecular plane give a clear indication of diamagnetic and paramagnetic ring currents. This method is applied to several (4n + 2)- and 4n pi-electron systems (molecules and ions) in the singlet and triplet electronic states, including some of the problematic systems mentioned above. It is also shown that relative aromaticities of rings in polycyclic systems (local aromaticities) cannot be estimated by comparing NICS or NICS-scan values.},

Although the hyperfine interaction (HFI) has been foreseen to have an important role in organic spin response, no clear experimental evidence has been reported so far. Using the chemical versatility advantage of the organics, we studied and compared spin responses in films, OLED and OSV devices based on pi-conjugated polymers made of protonated, H-, and deuterated, D-hydrogen having a weaker HFI strength. We demonstrate that the HFI does indeed have a crucial role in all three spin responses. OLED films based on the D-polymers show substantially narrower magneto-electroluminescence and ODMR responses, and as a result of the longer spin diffusion obtained, OSV devices based on D-polymers show a substantially larger magnetoresistance.},

  abstract     = {Magnetically induced current densities have been calculated for free-base porphynoids using the gauge including magnetically induce current (GIMIC) method. Numerical integration of the current density passing selected chemical bonds yields current pathways and the degree of aromaticity according to the magnetic criterion. The ring-current strengths of the porphins, chlorins, and bacteriochlorins are 1.5-2.5 times stronger than for benzene. The calculations show that the 18$\pi$ [16]annulene inner cross is not the correct picture of the aromatic pathway for porphyrins. All conjugated chemical bonds participate in the current transport independently of the formal number of $\pi$ electrons. The ring current branches at the pyrrolic rings taking both the outer and the inner route. The NH unit of the pyrrolic rings has a larger resistance and a weaker current strength than the pyrroles without inner hydrogens. The traditional 18$\pi$ [18]annulene with inactive NH bridges is not how the ring-current flows around the macroring. The porphins have the strongest ring current of ca. 27 nA/T among the investigated porphynoids. The current strengths of the chlorins and bacteriochlorins are 19-24 nA/T depending on whether the ring current is forced to pass an NH unit or not. The current strengths of the 3-fold and 4-fold $\beta$-saturated porphynoids are 13-17 nA/T, showing that the inner-cross 18$\pi$ [16]annulene pathway is not a preferred current route.},

We found two different contrast mechanisms, which were corroborated by density functional theory calculations: The greater electron density in bonds of higher bond order led to a stronger Pauli repulsion, which enhanced the brightness of these bonds in high-resolution AFM images. The apparent bond length in the AFM images decreased with increasing bond order because of tilting of the CO molecule at the tip apex.},

In 1858, the Möbius strip was discovered by Möbius and Listing. The Hückel rules for predicting aromaticity, stating that [4n + 2] $\pi$ electrons result in an aromatic system, work for planar molecules. Although molecules with Möbius geometry are not found in nature, chemists have tried to synthesize such molecules since the first theoretical prediction by Heilbronner in 1964 and the prediction of Möbius aromaticity for suitable compounds with [4n] $\pi$ electrons. However, Möbius-aromatic molecules have proved difficult to synthesize, and sometimes even to identify. Here we summarize recent contributions of several research groups that have succeeded in synthesizing Möbius-type molecules. The results of this survey lead us to suggest that the generation of Möbius topologies in expanded porphyrins is easier than hitherto appreciated.},

  abstract     = {The magnetically induced current densities for ring-shaped hydrocarbons are studied at the density functional theory (DFT) and second-order M{ø}ller-Plesset (MP2) levels using gauge-including atomic orbitals. The current densities are calculated using the gauge-including magnetically induced current approach. The calculations show that all studied hydrocarbon rings sustain strong diatropic and paratropic ring currents when exposed to an external magnetic field, regardless whether they are unsaturated or not. For nonaromatic rings, the strength of the paratropic current flowing inside the ring is as large as the diatropic one circling outside it, yielding a vanishing net ring current. For aromatic molecules, the diatropic current on the outside of the ring is much stronger than the paratropic one inside, giving rise to the net diatropic ring current that is typical for aromatic molecules. For antiaromatic molecules, the paratropic ring-current contribution inside the ring dominates. For homoaromatic molecules, the diatropic current circles at the periphery of the ring. The ring current is split at the CH(2) moiety; the main fraction of the current flow passes outside the CH(2) at the hydrogens, and some current flows inside the carbon atom. The diatropic current does not take the through-space short-cut pathway, whereas the paratropic current does take that route. Calculations of the ring-current profile show that the ring current of benzene is not transported by the pi electrons on both sides of the molecular ring. The strongest diatropic ring current flows on the outside of the ring and in the ring plane. A weaker paratropic current circles inside the ring with the largest current density in the ring plane. Due to the ring strain, small unconjugated and saturated hydrocarbon rings sustain a strong ring current which could be called ring-strain current. Nuclear magnetic shieldings calculated for 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and homotropylium at the DFT and MP2 levels agree well with experimental values.},

Even so, there have been many significant advances and a much greater understanding of the types of materials that will be useful in molecular electronics, and their properties. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad basis for understanding the areas where new advances might arise, and to provide introduction to the subdisciplines of molecular electronics. This review is divided into two major parts; an historical examination of the development of conventional electronics, which should provide some understanding of the push towards molecular electronics. The problems associated with continuing to shrink conventional systems are presented, along with references to some of the efforts to solve them. This section is followed by an in-depth look at the most important research into the types of behaviors that molecular systems have been found to display.},

  abstract     = {Since it was first suggested that a single molecule might function as an active electronic component, a number of techniques have been developed to measure the charge transport properties of single molecules. Although scanning tunnelling microscopy observations under high vacuum conditions can allow stable measurements of electron transport, most measurements of a single molecule bonded in a metal-molecule-metal junction exhibit relatively large variations in conductance. As a result, even simple predictions about how molecules behave in such junctions have still not been rigorously tested. For instance, it is well known that the tunnelling current passing through a molecule depends on its conformation; but although some experiments have verified this effect, a comprehensive mapping of how junction conductance changes with molecular conformation is not yet available. In the simple case of a biphenyl--a molecule with two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond--conductance is expected to change with the relative twist angle between the two rings, with the planar conformation having the highest conductance. Here we use amine link groups to form single-molecule junctions with more reproducible current-voltage characteristics. This allows us to extract average conductance values from thousands of individual measurements on a series of seven biphenyl molecules with different ring substitutions that alter the twist angle of the molecules. We find that the conductance for the series decreases with increasing twist angle, consistent with a cosine-squared relation predicted for transport through pi-conjugated biphenyl systems.},

  abstract     = {Orientation-selective DEER (Double Electron-Electron Resonance) measurements were conducted on a series of rigid and flexible molecules containing Cu(II) ions. A system with two rigidly held Cu(II) ions was afforded by the protein homo-dimer of copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis. This system provided experimental DEER data between two Cu(II) ions with a well-defined distance and relative orientation to assess the accuracy of the methodology. Evaluation of orientation-selective DEER (os DEER) on systems with limited flexibility was probed using a series of porphyrin-based Cu(II)–nitroxide and Cu(II)–Cu(II) model systems of well-defined lengths synthesized for this project. Density functional theory was employed to generate molecular models of the conformers for each porphyrin-based Cu(II) dimer studied. Excellent agreement was found between DEER traces simulated using these computed conformers and the experimental data. The performance of different parameterised structural models in simulating the experimental DEER data was also investigated. The results of this analysis demonstrate the degree to which the DEER data define the relative orientation of the two Cu(II) ions and highlight the need to choose a parameterised model that captures the essential features of the flexibility (rotational freedom) of the system being studied.},

The efficiency of intersystem crossing from the two singlet state conformations to a common triplet state is shown to be different. In a viscous medium, each excited state conformation can be prepared selectively. Hence, wavelength-specific irradiation of the porphyrin allows fine control over the concentration of the triplet state produced which, in turn, is reflected in the photosensitized yield of singlet oxygen. This property may be beneficial for many applications requiring the controlled release of an oxidizing species, e.g., microfabrication and singlet oxygen-mediated cell death.},

  abstract     = {We report variable temperature X-band EPR spectroscopic data for the cation radical states of meso-to-meso ethyne-bridged (porphinato)zinc(II) (PZnn) oligomers. These [PZn2-PZn7]+ species span an average 18-75 A length scale and display peak-to-peak EPR line widths (DeltaBp-p) that diminish with conjugation length. Analysis of these EPR data show that PZnn+ structures possess the largest hole polaron delocalization lengths yet measured; experiments carried out over a 4-298 K temperature domain demonstrate remarkably that the charge delocalization length remains invariant with temperature. These cation radical EPR data are well described by a stochastic, near barrierless, one-dimensional charge hopping model developed by Norris for N equivalent sites on a polymer chain, where the theoretical EPR line width is given by DeltaBp-p(N-mer) = (1/N1/2)DeltaBp-p(monomer); PZnn+ oligomers are the first such systems to verify a Norris-type hole delocalization mechanism over a substantial ( approximately 75 A) length scale. Given the time scale of the EPR measurement, these data show that either (i) Franck-Condon effects are incapable of driving charge localization in [PZn2-PZn7]+, resulting in cation radical wave functions which are globally delocalized over a spatial domain that is large with respect to established benchmarks for hole-doped conjugated materials, or (ii) polaron hopping rates in these oligomers exceed 107 s-1, even at 4 K. Finally, this study demonstrates that polymeric building blocks having low magnitude inner sphere reorganization energies enable the development of electronic materials having long polaron delocalization lengths.},

On the basis of magnetic susceptibility exaltation, nucleus-independent shift (NICS), and aromatic stabilization energy (ASE, evaluated via homodesmotic and isodesmic equations using B3LYP/6-311+G + ZPVE energies, as well as by MM3 and MM4 force field computations), we identified triene 17, a triply bridged analogue of 15, as the system where homoaromaticity is most effective. The NICS(total) in the center of 17 is -30.1 ppm and the diatropic pi-contribution is -18.0 ppm. This structure possesses more than one-third of the aromatic stabilization of benzene and is the best candidate for neutral tris-homoaromaticity ever proposed. The previously described tris-(bismethano)-benzene (15) also shows homoaromaticity but to a smaller extent compared to 17. Structure 18, which is closely related to 17, also is significantly homoaromatic but, as evaluated by MM3, strain partially counteracts the stabilizing effects from homoconjugation. Such a counteracting increase in strain largely cancels or even overwhelms the stabilization from homoconjugation in all other species considered in this study.},

Medical applications of two-photon excitation in photodynamic therapy(3,4) have been widely suggested(5-18), but thus far have been rendered impractical by the low two-photon cross-sections of photosensitizer drugs (which are compounds taken up by living tissues that become toxic on absorption of light). The invention of efficient two-photon activated drugs will allow precise three-dimensional manipulation of treatment volumes, providing a level of targeting unattainable with current therapeutic techniques. Here we present a new family of photodynamic therapy drugs designed for efficient two-photon excitation and use one of them to demonstrate selective closure of blood vessels through two-photon excitation photodynamic therapy in vivo. These conjugated porphyrin dimers have two-photon cross-sections that are more than two orders of magnitude greater than those of standard clinical photosensitizers(17). This is the first demonstration of in vivo photodynamic therapy using a photosensitizer engineered for efficient two-photon excitation.},

The extent of this increase depends on the dipolar character of both the solvent and solute as observed in differences in the shifts of the absorption spectra of two different classes of solvent polarity indicator dyes in a number of different frozen solvents. These findings cannot be explained solely by contributions from the contraction of the solvent at lower temperatures. Instead, the data are consistent with a model in which the local solvent organization around the solute increases as the temperature is lowered and depends on the dipolar properties of the solvent and solute. This ordering is preserved when the solvent freezes and leads to a much larger effective polarity in the vicinity of the solute that is not reflected in measurements of bulk solvent properties. Because this effective solvent polarity can affect electronic properties as well as reactivity of the solute, these results may have significant implications for the design of complex molecular systems in solid solution and models for protein function.},

The corresponding complexes of linear porphyrin oligomers were also investigated. The results reveal that the stepwise effective molarities (EMs) for the third through sixth intramolecular coordination events with the cyclic hexamer are extremely high (EM = 10(2)-10(3) M), whereas the values for the linear porphyrin oligomers are modest (EM ≈ 0.05 M).

  abstract     = {We report an extensive study of the properties of carbyne using first-principles calculations. We investigate carbyne's mechanical response to tension, bending, and torsion deformations. Under tension, carbyne is about twice as stiff as the stiffest known materials and has an unrivaled specific strength of up to 7.5 10(7) N{}m/kg, requiring a force of 10 nN to break a single atomic chain. Carbyne has a fairly large room-temperature persistence length of about 14 nm. Surprisingly, the torsional stiffness of carbyne can be zero but can be "switched on" by appropriate functional groups at the ends. Further, under appropriate termination, carbyne can be switched into a magnetic semiconductor state by mechanical twisting. We reconstruct the equivalent continuum elasticity representation, providing the full set of elastic moduli for carbyne, showing its extreme mechanical performance (e.g., a nominal Young's modulus of 32.7 TPa with an effective mechanical thickness of 0.772 Å). We also find an interesting coupling between strain and band gap of carbyne, which is strongly increased under tension, from 2.6 to 4.7 eV under a 10{\%} strain. Finally, we study the performance of carbyne as a nanoscale electrical cable and estimate its chemical stability against self-aggregation, finding an activation barrier of 0.6 eV for the carbyne-carbyne cross-linking reaction and an equilibrium cross-link density for two parallel carbyne chains of 1 cross-link per 17 C atoms (2.2 nm).},

  abstract     = {We outline a modular building block strategy for the covalent assembly of porphyrin-containing model systems. Molecular design issues for the synthesis of porphyrin dimers, dye-porphyrin dyads, and multi-porphyrin arrays have been used to guide the development of this approach. The major design constraints are to achieve directed coupling of free base and/or metalloporphyrin building blocks in dilute solution under non-acidic non-metalating conditions. A set of 24 porphyrin building blocks has been synthesized. The porphyrins are prepared by reaction of substituted benzaldehydes with pyrrole using the two-step one-flask room temperature porphyrin synthesis. Routes to 7 substituted aldehydes are described. Each porphyrin bears one or four functional groups, and many also are facially-encumbered in order to achieve increased solubility. 12 functional groups that meet the design criteria include those that can be reacted directly in coupling reactions such as active esters, alpha-chloroacetamido, benzoyl, and iodo groups, and others that require deprotection prior to coupling, such as phthalimidomethyl, FMOC-prolyl, trimethylsilylethynyl, dithiolane, methoxycarbonyl, and trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl groups. The synthesis of 13 porphyrin dimers and dye-porphyrin dyads has been explored as a testbed for refining strategies for the synthesis of molecular devices containing multiple porphyrins and other components. The coupling strategies investigated have yielded dimers or dyads with subunits linked by amide, butadiyne, ethyne, or thiourea groups. This building block approach should enable rapid assembly of architecturally-defined porphyrin-based model systems.},

  abstract     = {Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as an alternative to silicon-based solar cells because of their low-cost production and high power conversion efficiency. Among various sensitizers, numerous research activities have been focused on porphyrins due to their strong absorption bands in the visible region, versatile modifications of their core, and facile tuning of the electronic structures. In 2005-2007, Officer and Grätzel et al. had achieved a rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency of porphyrin DSSCs from a few percent to as much as 7{\%}. Encouraged by these pioneering works, further high-performance porphyrin dyes have been developed in the last decade. These studies have provided us profound hints for the rational design of sensitizers toward highly efficient DSSCs. Push-pull structures and/or $\pi$-extensions have made porphyrins panchromatic in visible and even near-infrared regions. Consequently, porphyrin sensitizers have exhibited power conversion efficiencies that are comparable to or even higher than those of well-established highly efficient DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes. So far the power conversion efficiency has increased up to ca. 13{\%} by using a push-pull porphyrin with a cobalt-based redox shuttle. In this perspective, we review the recent developments in the synthetic design of porphyrins for highly efficient DSSCs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, it has become possible to measure the mobility of charges along isolated chains of conjugated polymers. The mobility of holes along poly(phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene backbones were reported to be 0.43 and 0.02 cm2 V-1 s-1, respectively. The large difference between the mobility of holes on poly- (phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene chains can be attributed to deviations from the coplanar alignment of structural units in the polymer backbone. The effect of such torsional disorder on intramolecular hole transport is studied theoretically in this paper using a model based on the tight-binding approximation. The calculated ratio of hole mobilities along poly(phenylenevinylene) and polythiophene chains was found to be in agreement with experimental findings. For both polymers, estimated mobilities become consistent with the experimental values if polymerization defects and chain end effects are included in the calculations. This suggests that even higher mobilities than those reported here can be realized by improving the effective conjugation along the polymer chain.},

The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30{\%} for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current‐voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed.},

Experimental charge density analysis of the molecule showed that the acetylenic linkers have triple bond character close to an ideal triple bond, in clear contrast to the situation 1,2-diphenylacetylene, where the charge density parameters resemble more closely those of a double bond due to extended conjugation. The influence of the reduced conjugation on the transport characteristics has been obtained using the Landauer's formalism.

  abstract     = {Porphyrin macrocycles have been the subject of intense study in the last century because they are widely distributed in nature, usually as metal complexes of either iron or magnesium. As such, they serve as the prosthetic groups in a wide variety of primary metabolites, such as hemoglobins, myoglobins, cytochromes, catalases, peroxidases, chlorophylls, and bacteriochlorophylls; these compounds have multiple applications in materials science, biology and medicine. This article describes current methodology for preparation of simple, symmetrical model porphyrins, as well as more complex protocols for preparation of unsymmetrically substituted porphyrin macrocycles similar to those found in nature. The basic chemical reactivity of porphyrins and metalloporphyrin is also described, including electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions, oxidations, reductions, and metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions. Using the synthetic approaches and reactivity profiles presented, eventually almost any substituted porphyrin system can be prepared for applications in a variety of areas, including in catalysis, electron transport, model biological systems and therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated the influence of nuclear geometric relaxation on the extent of the excited-state electronic delocalization in conjugated zinc porphyrin oligomers using ultrafast transient photoluminescence spectroscopy. By use of metal-coordinating templates that force the oligomers into specific geometries in solution we are able to distinguish clearly between relaxation effects arising from the two vibrational modes that preferentially couple to the electronic transitions in such materials, i.e., carbon-carbon bond stretches and inter-ring torsions. We find that light absorption generates an excited state that is initially strongly delocalized along the oligomer but contracts rapidly following vibrational relaxation of the nuclei along C-C stretch coordinates on the subpicosecond time scale. We are able to monitor such excitonic self-trapping effects by observing the extent to which the concomitant ultrafast rotation of the transition dipole moment is found to correlate with the degree of bending induced in the molecular backbone. We further demonstrate that interporphyrin torsional relaxation leads to a subsequent increase in the excited-state electronic delocalization on a longer time scale (approximately 100 ps). Such dynamic planarization of the molecular backbone is evident from the time-dependent increase in the overall emission intensity and red-shift in the peak emission energy that can be observed for wormlike flexible porphyrin octamers but not for torsionally rigidified cyclic or double-strand octamer complexes. These results therefore indicate that, following excitation, the initially highly delocalized excited-state wave function first contracts and then expands again along the conjugated backbone in accordance with the time periods for the vibrational modes coupled to the electronic transition.},

  abstract     = {We report the synthesis of 7 new para-phenylene-bridged zinc porphyrin dimers, five of which were characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. A variety of links were tested for holding the para-phenylene bridges in $\pi$-conjugation with the porphyrins, and the natures of these restraining links strongly influence the properties of the porphyrin dimers. The keto-linked dimer exhibits a long-lived singlet excited state and strong fluorescence at 960 nm (1.7{\%} quantum yield) in contrast to most previously reported conjugated porphyrin tapes, which are essentially non-emissive. Replacement of the cross-conjugated keto links by directly conjugated CC bonds eradicates the fluorescence and shifts the absorption maximum to 1077 nm. On the other hand, replacement of the keto links with non-conjugated CPh2 links confers fluorescence at 736 nm (10{\%} quantum yield) and results in remarkably similar one- and two-photon absorption behavior to that of mesomeso ethynylene-bridged porphyrin dimers (peak two-photon cross section: 7,300 GM at 878 nm). Cross-conjugated keto links do more than just hold the para-phenylene bridge coplanar with the porphyrins; they reduce the HOMOLUMO gap, although to a lesser extent than direct $\pi$-conjugated links. Planarized para-phenylene-bridged porphyrin dimers provide insights into the relationship between previously investigated classes of conjugated porphyrin oligomers, and they open up possibilities for the synthesis of new types of near-IR two-photon absorbing dyes.},

More significantly, the fabrication, understanding and control of fully functional circuits at the single-molecule level could also open up the possibility of using molecules as devices with novel, not-foreseen functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS). This review aims at highlighting the chemical design and synthesis of single molecule devices as well as their electrical and structural characterization, including a historical overview and the developments during the last 5 years.

  abstract     = {The authors extend their recent method for the computation of vibrationally resolved optical spectra of large molecules, including both the Duschinsky rotation and the effect of finite temperature in the framework of the Franck-Condon (FC) approximation, to deal with the more general case of the Herzberg-Teller (HT) model, where also the linear dependence of the transition dipole moment on the nuclear coordinates is taken into account. This generalization allows us to investigate weak and vibronically allowed transitions by far extending the range of application of the method. The calculation of the spectra of sizable molecules is computationally demanding because of the huge number of final vibrational states that must be taken into account, and the inclusion of HT terms further increases the computational burden. The method presented here automatically selects the relevant vibronic contributions to the spectrum, independent of their frequency, and it is able to provide fully converged spectra with a modest computational requirement. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by computing the HT absorption and fluorescence Q(x) spectra of free-base porphyrin both at T=0 K and at room temperature, performing for the first time an exact treatment of vibrations in harmonic approximation. Q(x) spectra are compared to experiments and FC/HT interferences are analyzed in detail.},

  abstract     = {The gauge-including magnetically induced current method for calculating the components of the current-density tensor using gauge-including atomic orbitals has been extended to treating open-shell molecules. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by calculations of first-order induced current densities on cyclobutadiene, Al(3), and B(3) at correlated ab initio levels of theory. For comparison, current-density calculations were also performed on the lowest closed-shell singlet state of cyclobutadiene as well on the closed-shell Al(3)(-) and B(3)(-) anions. The ring-current susceptibilities of the open-shell species are computed at the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field, second-order M{ø}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles levels, whereas for the closed-shell systems also density functional theory calculations were employed. Explicit values for the current strengths caused by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons as well as the difference, representing the spin current, were obtained by numerical integration of the current-density contributions passing a plane perpendicular to the molecular ring. Comparisons of the present results to those recently obtained for the lowest triplet state of biphenyl emphasize that electron correlation effects must be considered for obtaining an accurate description of spin-current densities.},

The meso substituents, i.e., ethynyl, phenylethynyl, and phenylbutadiynyl, provided insight into the efficiency of spin density delocalization along structural elements that are typically applied to transmit electronic effects along multipart polyporphyrinic systems. The positive spin density localized at the meso-carbon of high-spin iron(III) ethynylporphyrins is effectively delocalized along the ethyne or butadiyne fragment as illustrated by the comparison of isotropic shifts of C(meso)-H and -CC-H determined for (TrPP)Fe(III)Cl (-82.6 ppm, 293 K) and (ETrTP)Fe(III)Cl (-49.5 ppm, 298 K). The replacement of the ethynyl hydrogen by phenyl or phenylethynyl provided evidence for the pi spin density distribution around the introduced phenyl ring. An analysis of the isotropic shifts for the low-spin bis-cyanide iron(III) porphyrins series reveals the analogous mechanism of spin density transfer. Treatment of high-spin [(TrTP)Fe(III)Cl]2 B with a base resulted in formation of the cyclic [(TrTP)Fe(III)OFe(III)(TrTP)B]2 complex linked by two mu-oxo bridges. (TPEP)H2 has been characterized by X-ray crystallography as a porphyrin dication where two molecules of trifluoroacetic acid associate with two coordinated trifluoroacetate anions.

  abstract     = {A series of five donor-bridge-acceptor (DBA) molecules in which the donor is tetracene, the acceptor is pyromellitimide, and the bridge molecules are oligo-p-phenylenevinylenes (OPV) of increasing length has been shown to undergo electron transfer (ET) by means of two mechanisms. When the bridge is short, strongly distance dependent superexchange dynamics dominates, whereas when the bridge is longer, bridge-assisted hopping dynamics prevails. The latter mechanism results in relatively soft distance dependence for ET in which the OPV oligomers act effectively as molecular wires. We now report studies on the critical influence that bridge dynamics have on electron transfer through these oligomers. The temperature dependence of the charge separation (CS) rates in all five molecules does not appear to obey the predictions of standard ET theories based upon the Condon approximation. All five molecules show behavior consistent with CS being "gated" by torsional motion between the tetracene donor and the first bridge phenyl ring. This is based on the near equivalence of the CS activation energies measured for all five molecules with the frequency of a known vibrational mode in 5-phenyltetracene. In the molecule containing a trans-stilbene bridge, a competition occurs between the tetracene-phenyl torsional motion and one that occurs between the vinyl group and the phenyls linked to it. This results in complex temperature-dependent CS that exhibits both activated and negatively activated regimes. The charge recombination (CR) reactions within the molecules which have the two shortest bridges, namely phenyl and trans-stilbene, show a weaker dependence on these molecular motions. The three molecules with the longest bridges all display complex temperature dependencies in both their rates of CS and CR, most likely because of the complex torsional motions, which arise from the multiple phenyl-vinyl linkages. The data show that long-distance electron transfer and therefore wire-like behavior within conjugated bridge molecules depend critically on these low-frequency torsional motions. Molecular device designs that utilize such bridges will need to address these issues.},

  abstract     = {The aromatic character of porphyrins, which has significant chemical and biological consequences, can be substantially altered by judicious modifications of the parent ring system. Expansion of the macrocycle, which is achieved by introducing additional subunits, usually increases the so-called free curvature of the ring, leading to larger angular strain. This strain is reduced by a variety of conformational changes, most notably by subunit inversion and p surface twisting. The latter effect creates a particularly convenient access to Möbius aromatic molecules, whose properties, predicted over 40 years ago, are of considerable theoretical importance. The conformational processes occurring in porphyrin analogues are often coupled to other chemical phenomena, and can thus be exploited as a means of constructing functional molecular devices. In this Review, the structural chemistry of porphyrinoids is discussed in the context of their conformational dynamics and p-electron conjugation.},

  abstract     = {The AIM parameters at the ring critical point (the electron density and its Laplacian, the total electron energy density and both its components, potential and kinetic electron energy densities), have been intercorrelated with aromaticity indices: the geometry-based HOMA and the magnetism-based NICS, NICS(1), and NICS(1)(zz). A set of 33 phenylic rings having possibly a diversified aromatic character, and a set of 20 quasi-rings formed by intramolecular hydrogen and lithium bonds, have been taken into consideration. It has been found that the density of total electron energy, H, may serve as a new quantitative characteristic of pi-electron delocalization. The dependences between H values and aromaticity indices are correlated (cc(H/HOMA)=0.99, cc(H/NICS(1)zz)=0.95).},

Results from the Coulomb-attenuated CAM-B3LYP functional are compared with those from the conventional BHHLYP and B3LYP hybrid functionals. BLA values and HO-LU gaps are determined using both finite oligomer and infinite chain calculations, subject to periodic boundary conditions. TDDFT excitation energies are determined for the oligomers. The oligomer excitation energies and HO-LU gaps are then used, in conjunction with the infinite chain HO-LU gap, to estimate the infinite chain excitation energy. Overall, BHHLYP and CAM-B3LYP give BLA values and excitation energies that are larger and more accurate than those obtained using B3LYP. The results highlight the degree to which excitation energies can be approximated using the HO-LU gaps-at the infinite limit, this approximation works well for B3LYP, but not for the other functionals, where the HO-LU gap is significantly larger. The study provides further evidence for the high-quality theoretical predictions that can be obtained from the CAM-B3LYP functional.},

  abstract     = {Control of conductance in molecular junctions is of key importance in the growing field of molecular electronics. The current in these junctions is often controlled by an electric gate designed to shift conductance peaks into the low bias regime. Magnetic fields, on the other hand, have rarely been used due to the small magnetic flux captured by molecular conductors (an exception is the Kondo effect in single-molecule transistors). This is in contrast to a related field, electronic transport through mesoscopic devices, where considerable activity with magnetic fields has led to a rich description of transport. The scarcity of experimental activity is due to the belief that significant magnetic response is obtained only when the magnetic flux is of the order of the quantum flux, while attaining such a flux for molecular and nanoscale devices requires unrealistic magnetic fields. Here we review recent theoretical work regarding the essential physical requirements necessary for the construction of nanometer-scale magnetoresistance devices based on an Aharonov-Bohm molecular interferometer. We show that control of the conductance properties using small fractions of a magnetic flux can be achieved by carefully adjusting the lifetime of the conducting electrons through a pre-selected single state that is well separated from other states due to quantum confinement effects. Using a simple analytical model and more elaborate atomistic calculations we demonstrate that magnetic fields which give rise to a magnetic flux comparable to 10(-3) of the quantum flux can be used to switch a class of different molecular and nanometer rings, ranging from quantum corrals, carbon nanotubes and even a molecular ring composed of polyconjugated aromatic materials. The unique characteristics of the magnetic field as a gate is further discussed and demonstrated in two different directions. First, a three-terminal molecular router devices that can function as a parallel logic gate, processing two logic operations simultaneously, is presented. Second, the role of inelastic effects arising from electron-phonon couplings on the magnetoresistance properties is analyzed. We show that a remarkable difference between electric and magnetic gating is also revealed when inelastic effects become significant. The inelastic broadening of response curves to electric gates is replaced by a narrowing of magnetoconductance peaks, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the device.},

  abstract     = {Aromaticity cannot be measured directly by any physical or chemical experiment because it is not a well-defined magnitude. Its quantification is done indirectly from the measure of different properties that are usually found in aromatic compounds such as bond length equalisation, energetic stabilisation, and particular magnetic behaviour associated with induced ring currents. These properties have been used to set up the myriad of structural-, energetic-, and magnetic-based indices of aromaticity known to date. The cyclic delocalisation of mobile electrons in two or three dimensions is probably one of the key aspects that characterise aromatic compounds. However, it has not been until the last decade that electron delocalisation measures have been widely employed to quantify aromaticity. Some of these new indicators of aromaticity such as the PDI, FLU, ING, and INB were defined in our group. In this paper, we review the different existing descriptors of aromaticity that are based on electron delocalisation properties, we compare their performance with indices based on other properties, and we summarise a number of applications of electronic-based indices for the analysis of aromaticity in interesting chemical problems.},

Here we show that two closely related bis-rhodium hexaphyrins (R26H and R28H) containing [26] and [28] $\pi$-electron peripheries, respectively, exhibit properties consistent with Baird's rule. In the ground state, R26H exhibits a sharp Soret-like band and distinct Q-like bands characteristic of an aromatic porphyrinoid, whereas R28H exhibits a broad absorption spectrum without Q-like bands, which is typical of an antiaromatic porphyrinoid. In contrast, the T–T absorption of R26H is broad, weak and featureless, whereas that of R28H displays an intense and sharp Soret-like band. These spectral signatures, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, are in line with qualitative expectations based on Baird's rule.},

  abstract     = {Templates are widely used to arrange molecular components so they can be covalently linked into complex molecules that are not readily accessible by classical synthetic methods. Nature uses sophisticated templates such as the ribosome, whereas chemists use simple ions or small molecules. But as we tackle the synthesis of larger targets, we require larger templates-which themselves become synthetically challenging. Here we show that Vernier complexes can solve this problem: if the number of binding sites on the template, n(T), is not a multiple of the number of binding sites on the molecular building blocks, n(B), then small templates can direct the assembly of relatively large Vernier complexes where the number of binding sites in the product, n(P), is the lowest common multiple of n(B) and n(T) (refs 8, 9). We illustrate the value of this concept for the covalent synthesis of challenging targets by using a simple six-site template to direct the synthesis of a 12-porphyrin nano-ring with a diameter of 4.7nm, thus establishing Vernier templating as a powerful new strategy for the synthesis of large monodisperse macromolecules.},

While these molecules have similar conjugation length, they exhibit strikingly different vibronic spectroscopy and photophysics. The near-UV LIF excitation spectrum of diphenyldiacetylene has its electronic origin at 32,158 cm(-1), and a strong progression in the CC stretch (2156 cm(-1)). All transitions are inherently broad, with widths of {\~{}}30 cm(-1) fwhm or greater. The S(1) origin DFL spectrum is composed of sharp transitions with Franck-Condon activity mirroring that in the excitation spectrum, and broad emission shifted well to the red ascribable to phosphorescence on the $\mu$s timescale. Using ab initio calculations, it is possible to show that DPDA exists as a single, planar conformer with D(2h) symmetry. In contrast, trans-diphenylvinylacetylene shows intense sharp transitions in both LIF and DFL spectra with an S(0)-S(1) origin of 31,183.2 cm(-1) and long progressions involving the in-plane fundamentals $\nu$(53) (bridge-phenyl bending) and $\nu$(51) (bridge-phenyl stretch). A sharp reduction in fluorescence yield in DPVA occurs within 300 cm(-1) of the S(1) origin. Possible causes for the photophysical processes occurring in the two molecules are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Substituents containing magnetically anisotropic chemical bonds, e.g. double bonds, triple bonds or the aromatic phenyl ring, influence the shielding of any nucleus in the molecule by their anisotropy effect dependent on its geometrical position. This effect of the magnetic anisotropy of neighbouring groups on the chemical shift of nuclei is usually specified qualitatively by the anisotropy cone. In this paper, the magnetic anisotropy effect of unsaturated chemical bonds and the ring current effect in arenes have been quantitatively calculated as nuclear independent chemical shieldings (NICSs) in a three dimensional grid of lattice points around the molecule using the GIAO method integrated into the GAUSSIAN 94 calculation program. Plotting the shielding/deshielding data thus obtained as iso-chemical-shielding surfaces (ICSS) around the magnetically anisotropic moieties allows us to quantify both direction and scale of the anisotropy effect. The calculation of the anisotropy effect of double and triple bonds, and the ring current effect of the phenyl ring, has been applied to a number of stereochemical problems; especially in conformational analysis this method proved very successful in quantitatively assigning 1H chemical shifts and hereby the stereochemistry of the molecules studied. In addition, contributions to 1H chemical shifts based on the anisotropy effect of neighbouring groups and based on other substituent effects could be differentiated quantitatively. Considerable deviations from the qualitative sketches of the anisotropy effects of double and triple bonds published in text books were found.},

  abstract     = {The infrared (IR) spectrum of an adamantyl endcapped $\alpha$, $\omega$-polyyne (the hexayne, Ad-C(12)-Ad) is investigated both experimentally and computationally. A new IR band is observed upon UV photoexcitation of the compound (embedded in a poly methyl methacrylate matrix at 78 K), thus, revealing the existence of new photogenerated molecular structure trapped at low temperature. Complete reversibility is found, thus, demonstrating that the photoexcitation is responsible for the generation of metastable excited states of the molecule. Density functional theory and time dependent density functional theory calculations indicate that these metastable states result from the forbidden singlet (S(1)) or triplet (T(1)) excited states, and geometry optimizations of the polyyne trapped in either S(1) and/or T(1) states demonstrate that the carbon chain takes on a cumulenic structure. Comparison of the experimental and the computed IR spectra for the molecule trapped in the forbidden states confirms that the new IR features are clear markers of cumulenic species. The temperature and time dependent behavior of the new IR band is analyzed, while the experimentally determined value of the activation energy highlights the low stability of these molecular structures.},

Here, we employ transient Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) to study photogenerated triplet states of these complexes in frozen solution with a particular focus on the extent of spin delocalisation. We make use of two different techniques: (i) the zero-field splitting parameters D and E are determined using transient continuous wave (cw) EPR spectroscopy and (ii) the hyperfine coupling constants, which directly reveal the extent of spin delocalisation, are quantified by orientation-selective proton Electron Nuclear DOuble Resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. It is found that ladder formation does not encourage triplet state delocalisation either across the bridging ligand DABCO or along the individual porphyrin strands despite their co-planar conformation, which was previously shown to allow increased electronic delocalisation.},

For short oligomers addition of a second electron gave a single band demonstrating the classic polaron-bipolaron transition. However, for long oligomers double reductions yielded spectra with two bands, better described as two polarons, possibly residing side-by-side in the F(n) chains. The singly reduced anions do not appear to delocalize over the entire length of the longer conjugated systems; instead they are polarons occupying approximately four fluorene repeat units. The polarons of F(3) and F(4) display sharp absorption bands, but for longer oligomers the bands broaden, possibly due to fluctuations of the lengths of these unconfined polarons. DFT calculations with long-range-corrected functionals were fully consistent with the experiments describing polarons in anions, bipolarons in dianions of short oligomers, and side-by-side polarons in dianions of long oligomers, while results from standard functionals were not compatible with the experimental results. The computations found F(10)(2-), for example, to be an open-shell singlet ({<}S(2){>} ≈ 1), with electrons in two side-by-side orbitals, while dianions of shorter oligomers experienced a gradual transition to bipolarons with states of intermediate character at intermediate lengths. The energies and extinction coefficients of each anionic species were measured by ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared absorption spectroscopy with chemical reduction and pulse radiolysis. Reduction potentials determined from equilibria mirrored oxidation potentials reported by Chi and Wegner. Anions of oligomers four or more units in length contained vestigial neutral (VN) absorption bands that arise from neutral parts of the chain. Energies of the VN bands correspond to those of oligomers shorter by four units.},

  abstract     = {A series of meso-meso-linked diporphyrins S(n) strapped with a dioxymethylene group of various length were synthesized by intramolecular Ag(I)-promoted coupling of dioxymethylene-bridged diporphyrins B(n), for n=10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. Shortening of the strap length causes a gradual decrease in the dihedral angle between the porphyrins and increasing distortion of porphyrin ring, as suggested by MM2 calculations and (1)H NMR studies. This trend has been also suggested by X-ray crystallographic studies on the corresponding Cu(II) complexes of nonstrapped diporphyrin 2 Cu, and strapped diporphyrins S(8)Cu, S(4)Cu, and S(2)Cu. The absorption spectrum of relatively unconstrained diporphyrins S(10) strapped with a long chain exhibits split Soret bands at 414 and 447 nm and weak Q(0,0)- and prominent Q(1,0)-bands, both of which are similar to those of nonstrapped diporphyrin 2. Shortening of the strap length causes systematic changes in the absorption spectra, in which the intensities of the split Soret bands decrease, the absorption bands at about 400 nm and {>} 460 nm increase in intensity, and a prominent one-band feature of a Q-band is changed to a distinct two-band feature with concurrent progressive red-shifts of the lowest Q(0,0)-band. The fluorescence spectra also exhibit systematic changes, roughly reflecting the changes of the absorption spectra. The strapped diporphyrins S(n) are all chiral and have been separated into enantiomers over a chiral column. The CD spectra of the optically active S(n) display two Cotton effects at 430-450 and at about 400 nm with the opposite signs. The latter effect can be explained in terms of oblique arrangement of m( perpendicular 1) and m( perpendicular 2) dipole moments, while the former effect cannot be accounted for within a framework of the excition coupling theory. The resonance Raman (RR) spectra taken for excitation at 457.9 nm are variable among S(n), while the RR spectra taken for excitation at 488.0 nm are constant throughout the S(n) series. These photophysical properties can be explained in terms of INDO/S-SCI calculations, which have revealed charge transfer (CT) transitions accidentally located close in energy to the excitonic Soret transitions. This feature arises from a close proximity of the two porphyrins in meso-meso-linked diporphyrins. In addition to the gradual red-shift of the exciton split Soret band, the calculations predict that the high-energy absorption band at about 400 nm, the lower energy Cotton effect, and the RR spectra taken for excitation at 457.9 nm are due to the CT states which are intensified upon a decrease in the dihedral angle.},

The torsional spectrum of 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)-2,3,5,6-tetradeuteriobenzene was also recorded in the gas phase. Both spectra were successfully simulated using simple cosine potentials to describe the torsional motions. The ground-state barrier to rotation was estimated to be 220-235 cm(-1), which is similar to that of diphenylacetylene (tolane). Complementary DFT calculations were found to overestimate the torsional barrier.},

In this review we present the fundamental aspects of covalently linked cyclic porphyrin arrays by highlighting recent progress. The major emphasis of this tutorial review lies on the synthetic method, the structure, and the excitation energy transfer (EET) of such arrays. The final cyclization steps were often performed with the aid of templates. Efficient EET along the wheel is observed in these cyclic arrays, but ultrafast EET processes with rates of {<}1 ps, which rival those in the natural LH2, are rare and have been identified only in cyclic arrays 30-32 composed of directly meso-meso linked porphyrins.},
